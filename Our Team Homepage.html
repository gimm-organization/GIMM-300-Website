<p>My name is Christian.  I am an active gamer and designer.  The one genre I am most interested in is racing/simulation.  Because of this, I have begun creating my own personal project of a top-down 2D car simulator.  I am working out how to make the cars feel more real when turning or braking.  I hope to complete it soon to share it with the world.  I joined the GIMM program to help solidify my hope.</p>

<p>I have been a graphic designer and web developer for over 10 years, and I was the Creative Director for Knitting Factory Entertainment for a few of those years. I love seeing ideas go from discussion to completion, so you can say I am not only a front-end developer, but a back-end developer as well. I am currently a GIMM major, and minoring in Computer Science, with already an Associate’s of Art degree. I have dabbled in physics and philosophy as well, so I am always up for interesting conversations. </p>
